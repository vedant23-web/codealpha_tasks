Task_3 - Sudoku Solver (C++) 

This project is developed as part of my C++ Programming Internship at CodeAlpha.

In this project, I implemented a Sudoku Solver using C++. The program solves a 9×9 Sudoku puzzle using the Backtracking Algorithm.

Project Description:
The Sudoku grid is represented using a 2D array.
The program takes input from the user where 0 represents empty cells.
It then recursively fills the empty cells while following Sudoku rules:
No repeated number in a row.
No repeated number in a column.
No repeated number in a 3×3 subgrid.
If a number placement leads to a wrong solution, the algorithm backtracks and tries another number.
