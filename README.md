## Task_1 - CGPA Calculator (C++)

This project is developed as part of my C++ Programming Internship at CodeAlpha.

In this project, I implemented a CGPA Calculator using C++. The program calculates the GPA for each semester and the overall CGPA based on the grades and credit hours entered by the user.

Project Description: The program first takes input for the number of semesters. For each semester, it takes the number of courses along with the grade and credit hours for each course. It calculates total grade points using the formula (grade × credit hours) and computes the semester GPA. Finally, it calculates and displays the overall CGPA based on all semesters. The output is formatted to show the CGPA up to two decimal places.

## Task_3 - Sudoku Solver (C++) 

This project is developed as part of my C++ Programming Internship at CodeAlpha.

In this project, I implemented a Sudoku Solver using C++. The program solves a 9×9 Sudoku puzzle using the Backtracking Algorithm.

Project Description:
The Sudoku grid is represented using a 2D array.
The program takes input from the user where 0 represents empty cells.
It then recursively fills the empty cells while following Sudoku rules:
No repeated number in a row.
No repeated number in a column.
No repeated number in a 3×3 subgrid.
If a number placement leads to a wrong solution, the algorithm backtracks and tries another number.

## Task_4 - Banking System (C++)

This project is developed as part of my C++ Programming Internship at CodeAlpha.

In this project, I implemented a Banking System using C++. The program simulates basic banking operations such as account creation, deposit, withdrawal, fund transfer, and transaction history management using Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

Project Description:
The system is designed using three main classes: Customer, Account, and Transaction. The program allows users to create and manage customer accounts. It supports deposit and withdrawal operations with proper balance validation. It also includes a fund transfer feature between accounts. All transactions are stored and can be viewed as transaction history. The system displays account details including balance and transaction information to the user.
