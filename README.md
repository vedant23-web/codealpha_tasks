Task_3 - Sudoku Solver (C++) 

This project is developed as part of my C++ Programming Internship at CodeAlpha.

In this project, I implemented a Sudoku Solver using C++. The program solves a 9×9 Sudoku puzzle using the Backtracking Algorithm.

Project Description:
The Sudoku grid is represented using a 2D array.
The program takes input from the user where 0 represents empty cells.
It then recursively fills the empty cells while following Sudoku rules:
No repeated number in a row.
No repeated number in a column.
No repeated number in a 3×3 subgrid.
If a number placement leads to a wrong solution, the algorithm backtracks and tries another number.

Task_4 - Banking System (C++)

This project is developed as part of my C++ Programming Internship at CodeAlpha.

In this project, I implemented a Banking System using C++. The program simulates basic banking operations such as account creation, deposit, withdrawal, fund transfer, and transaction history management using Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

Project Description:
The system is designed using three main classes: Customer, Account, and Transaction. The program allows users to create and manage customer accounts. It supports deposit and withdrawal operations with proper balance validation. It also includes a fund transfer feature between accounts. All transactions are stored and can be viewed as transaction history. The system displays account details including balance and transaction information to the user.
